**Option 1: No-Code MVP**
- Use tools like Bubble.io, Softr, or Airtable
- Build working version in 4-6 weeks
- Cost: $100-500/month
- You can build this yourself (with tutorials)

**Option 2: Hire Developer**
- Build custom Slackbot + Web app
- 3-4 months timeline
- Cost: $15k-40k
- More flexible, fully custom

**Option 3: Find Technical Co-founder**
- Equity split
- Build together
- Takes longer but no cash outlay

**Option 4: Raise Pre-seed Funding**
- Use prototype + validation data
- Apply to Y Combinator, Techstars, etc.
- Raise $100k-500k
- Hire small team

### If Validation is MIXED (40-70% interested):

1. **Dig deeper**: More interviews
2. **Pivot**: Adjust the concept
3. **Refine**: Improve the prototype
4. **Test again**: With different audience

### If Validation is WEAK (<40% interested):

1. **Honest assessment**: Is this solving a real problem?
2. **Different market**: Try B2C instead? Or different industry?
3. **Shelve for now**: No shame in this - better to learn early!
