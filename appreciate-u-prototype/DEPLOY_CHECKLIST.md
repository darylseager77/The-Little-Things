## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create ZIP File (1 min)

**On Mac:**
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate **INTO** the folder: `Documents/GitHub/The-Little-Things/appreciate-u-prototype/`
3. Select ONLY these 4 files (NOT the folder):
   - index.html
   - app.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js
4. Right-click on the selected files → "Compress 4 Items"
5. You'll get `Archive.zip`

**Important:** The files must be at the root of the ZIP, not inside a folder!

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify (2 min)

1. Go to **[app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)**
2. Sign up (free) or log in
3. Look for: **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"**
4. **Drag and drop** your `Archive.zip` file onto the box
5. Wait 15 seconds ⏱️
6. **Done!** Your site is live 🎉

### Step 3: Customize URL (1 min)

Netlify gives you: `random-name-123.netlify.app`

**To change it:**
1. Click "Site settings"
2. Click "Change site name"
3. Enter: `appreciate-u` (or your preferred name)
4. Your URL becomes: **`appreciate-u.netlify.app`**

### Step 4: Test It (2 min)

Visit your site and test the flow:
1. ✅ Go to `appreciate-u.netlify.app` - Should show landing page with context
2. ✅ Click "Try as Employee" - Should start the quiz
3. ✅ Click "Try as Manager" - Should jump to manager dashboard
4. ✅ Complete employee flow and verify dashboards work
5. ✅ Test on mobile (should be responsive)

The new flow: **Landing → Choose Role → Experience the prototype**

The landing page explains the concept, then you can choose to
explore as either an Employee or Manager to see both experiences.
