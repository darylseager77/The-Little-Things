# Category Naming - Finding the Right Words

## The Challenge

The original love languages are crystal clear:
- **Words of Affirmation** - you know exactly what this means
- **Quality Time** - obvious
- **Acts of Service** - clear
- **Receiving Gifts** - clear
- **Physical Touch** - clear (but needs work adaptation)

Our current workplace versions are too vague:
- "Connection" - connection to what? Could mean anything
- "Praise" - okay but corporate-y
- "Support" - too broad, generic HR-speak
- "Appreciation" - could mean all of the categories
- "Engagement" - vague corporate buzzword

**We need**: Clear, tangible, instantly understandable, workplace-appropriate names.

## Option A: Stay Closest to Original (Most Clear)

| Category | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Quality Time** | 1-on-1s, mentorship, deep conversations, being heard |
| **Words of Encouragement** | Verbal recognition, thank yous, acknowledgment, praise |
| **Acts of Service** | Helping with workload, removing blockers, practical support |
| **Gifts & Rewards** | Bonuses, time off, tangible perks, experiences |
| **Team Connection** | Collaboration, being included, team activities, belonging |

**Pros:**
- Clearest and most tangible
- People familiar with love languages will instantly get it
- "Quality Time" and "Acts of Service" are not trademarked as standalone phrases
- Easy to explain with examples

**Cons:**

## Testing the Names

Here's how I'd test these with real people in your interviews:

**Test 1: Instant Understanding**
"When I say [category name], what comes to mind?"
- If they get it immediately → good name
- If they're confused → bad name

**Test 2: Personal Resonance**
"Which of these 5 categories matters most to you at work?"
- If they can easily choose → good names
- If they need lots of explanation → bad names

**Test 3: Examples Match**
Show them examples and ask: "Which category is this?"
- If they match correctly → good names
- If they're confused → need clearer names

---

## Alternative Short Names (For App UI)

If you need really short labels for mobile app buttons or Slack commands:

| Long Name | Short Name | Icon |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Quality Time | **Time** | ⏰ |
| Recognition | **Words** | 💬 |
| Practical Support | **Help** | 🤝 |
| Rewards | **Rewards** | 🎁 |
| Inclusion | **Together** | 👥 |

You could use short names in compact UI and full names in explanations.

## What About "Appreciate U" vs "The Little Things"?

Since you mentioned these are both in play, here's how the names work with each brand:

### With "**Appreciate U**" Brand:
Frame as: "5 Ways to Appreciate Your Team"
- Quality Time
- Recognition
- Practical Support
- Rewards
- Inclusion

→ Direct, action-oriented, clear

### With "**The Little Things**" Brand:
Frame as: "The Little Things That Make People Feel Valued"
- Quality Time
- Recognition
- Practical Support
- Rewards
- Inclusion

→ Warmer, more personal, story-driven

**Both work!** The category names stay the same.

## Next Steps

1. **Pick your top 2-3 naming options** (I recommend Option F as starting point)
2. **Test them in your first 5 interviews** - see what resonates
3. **Be willing to adjust** - if people are confused by one name, swap it
4. **Lock it down** before building the quiz, so scoring is consistent

Want me to:
- Update the survey/interview questions with your chosen names?
- Create visual mockups showing how these names would appear in the app?
- Draft the quiz questions using the final category names?

Let me know which option resonates with you! Or feel free to mix and match - like "Quality Time" from Option A and "Recognition" from Option B, etc.
