# Building Your Prototype & Website - Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview

You need two things:
1. **Clickable Prototype** - To test the concept and get feedback BEFORE building anything real
2. **Website/Landing Page** - To collect waitlist signups and explain the concept

Let's tackle both with the easiest, no-code approaches.

---

# PART 1: CLICKABLE PROTOTYPE (No Coding Required!)

## What is a Clickable Prototype?

A fake version of your app that LOOKS real but doesn't actually work. You can click through screens to show people how it would work, get feedback, and test your ideas before spending money on development.

**Tools we'll use**: Figma (free, web-based, no download needed)

---

## Step-by-Step: Create Prototype in Figma

### Step 1: Set Up Figma (5 minutes)

1. Go to **figma.com**
2. Click "Get started for free"
3. Sign up with your email
4. Choose "Free" plan (perfect for this)
5. You'll land in Figma's workspace

### Step 2: Start a New Project (2 minutes)

1. Click "+ New design file"
2. Name it "The Little Things - Workplace App"
3. You'll see a blank canvas (like a whiteboard)

### Step 3: Set Up Your Screens (10 minutes)

**Create phone-sized frames** (even if it's a web app, mobile frames are easier to start with):

1. Press **F** on keyboard (or click Frame tool on left)
2. On the right panel, choose **"iPhone 14 Pro"** (or any phone size)
3. This creates a phone screen outline
4. Click the frame, hold **Alt** (or **Option** on Mac), and drag to duplicate it
5. Create 8-10 frames for different screens

**Name your frames** (double-click the frame name):
- Welcome Screen
- Quiz Question 1
- Quiz Question 2
- Results Screen
- Dashboard
- Check-in Screen
- Recognition Screen

### Step 4: Design Your Screens (Option A: Easy Way)

**Use a Template** (if you want to move fast):

1. In Figma, go to "Community" (top left)
2. Search for "mobile app template" or "quiz app"
3. Find one you like (free ones are marked)
4. Click "Duplicate" to copy it to your workspace
5. Replace the text/images with your content

### Step 4: Design Your Screens (Option B: From Scratch)

**I'll help you create the designs!**

Want me to create the actual Figma designs for you? I can:
1. Design the key screens based on your brand
2. Give you a Figma link to duplicate
3. You customize the text/colors/images

Just say "yes, please create the Figma designs" and I'll build them for you.

### Step 5: Make It Clickable (15 minutes)

Once you have screens designed:

1. Click the **Prototype** tab (top right, next to "Design")
2. Click a button on Screen 1
3. A blue dot appears - drag it to Screen 2
4. This creates a connection: "When clicked, go to Screen 2"
5. Repeat for all buttons/interactions

**Example flow**:
- Welcome Screen "Start Quiz" button → Quiz Question 1
- Quiz Question 1 "Next" button → Quiz Question 2
- Final Question "See Results" button → Results Screen

### Step 6: Test Your Prototype (5 minutes)

1. Click the **Play button** (▶️) in top right
2. Your prototype opens in a new tab
3. Click around to test the flow
4. Make sure all buttons work

### Step 7: Share with Others (2 minutes)

1. Click the **Share** button (top right)
2. Change "Only people invited" to **"Anyone with the link"**
3. Make sure "can view" is selected
4. Copy the link
5. Send to people for feedback!

**They can**:
- Click through your prototype
- Leave comments on specific screens
- Give feedback

## Prototype Testing Script

When you show the prototype to people:

**Say this**:
"I'm building a tool to help leaders understand how their team wants to be appreciated. This is a clickable prototype - it's not real yet, just a concept. I'll send you a link, and you can click through it. Then I'd love to hear: Does this make sense? Would you use it? What's confusing?"

**After they test**:
1. What was your first impression?
2. What was confusing?
3. What's missing?
4. Would you actually use this?

# PART 2: WEBSITE / LANDING PAGE

Let's check what you currently have, then build the right thing.

---

## Step 1: Check Your Current Website (5 minutes)

Let's see what's at littlethings.me right now:

**I'll check for you:**

Want me to check what's currently hosted at littlethings.me and report back? I can tell you:

Understand How Your Team Wants to Be Valued

Most leaders are guessing. Your team members have different
preferences for recognition. Some value quality time, others
want verbal acknowledgment, some need practical help.

[Join the Waitlist]
```

**Section 2: The Problem**
```
Sound Familiar?

❌ You give recognition that doesn't land

```
The Little Things helps you:

✓ Understand each team member's preferences
✓ Get personalized suggestions for meaningful recognition
✓ Quick check-ins (30 seconds, not 30 minutes)
