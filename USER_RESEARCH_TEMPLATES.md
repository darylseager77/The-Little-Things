### THE LITTLE THINGS - Interview Guide

**Goal**: Understand how people experience recognition at work, what's meaningful to them, and validate our core concept.

**Format**: Conversational, not interrogative. Let them tell stories.

---

#### INTRODUCTION (2 minutes)

"Hi! Thanks so much for taking the time. I'm working on a tool called 'The Little Things' that helps leaders understand how their team members prefer to be recognized and supported at work.

The idea is that everyone has different preferences - some people love public shout-outs, others prefer private thank-yous, some want help with their workload, others want quality time with their manager. But most leaders are just guessing.

I want to spend about 20-30 minutes learning about your experiences with recognition and support at work. There are no wrong answers - I'm just trying to understand what matters to people.

Can I record this conversation for my notes? It's just for me, won't be shared."

---

#### PART 1: Current Experience (7-10 minutes)

**Warm-up questions:**

1. **Tell me about your current role. What does a typical week look like for you?**
   - *Listen for: stress level, autonomy, team dynamics*

2. **When was the last time you felt genuinely appreciated at work?**
   - *Follow up*: What happened? What made it feel meaningful?
   - *Listen for: specific actions, context, who did it*

3. **When you think about the best manager or leader you've worked with, how did they show you that you were valued?**
   - *Listen for: patterns, specific behaviors*

**Diving deeper:**

4. **Have you ever received recognition that felt... off? Like it didn't quite land or felt forced?**
   - *Follow up*: What was it? Why didn't it resonate?
   - *Listen for: mismatched preferences, generic recognition*

5. **What about the opposite - have you seen someone else get recognition and thought "wow, that would be perfect for me" or "that would do nothing for me"?**
   - *Listen for: awareness of different preferences*

6. **(If they're a leader)** **How do you currently figure out how to recognize or support your team members?**
   - *Follow up*: Do you know each person's preferences? How did you learn them?
   - *Listen for: trial and error, explicit conversations, assumptions*

---

#### PART 2: The Concept Test (8-10 minutes)

**Introduce the framework:**

"So here's the core idea I'm exploring. Research shows that people tend to have different 'languages' for how they prefer to be appreciated. We've adapted this for the workplace into 5 categories:

1. **Connection** - Regular 1-on-1s, mentorship, quality time, being heard
2. **Praise** - Verbal recognition, thank you notes, public shout-outs, compliments
3. **Support** - Helping with workload, flexibility, removing blockers, acts of service
4. **Appreciation** - Tangible things like bonuses, gifts, time off, experiences
5. **Engagement** - Team activities, collaboration, being included in decisions

Most people value all of these to some degree, but usually 1-2 really stand out as most meaningful."

**Questions:**

7. **Does this framework resonate with you? Which 1-2 categories feel most important to you personally?**
   - *Listen for: immediate reaction, does it click?*

8. **Can you give me an example of when you received [their top category] and it made a difference?**
   - *Validate their understanding*

9. **What about the category you ranked lowest - why is that less meaningful to you?**
   - *Understand the contrast*

10. **(If they're a leader)** **Thinking about your team, do you think different people would rank these differently?**
    - *Follow up*: Can you think of specific examples?
    - *Listen for: awareness of individual differences*

---

#### PART 3: The Solution Test (8-10 minutes)

**Describe the tool concept:**

"Okay, so here's what I'm thinking of building:

A super simple tool - probably a Slack bot or quick app - that:
1. Helps you identify YOUR preferences through a quick quiz
2. Lets you share those preferences with your manager (opt-in)
3. Gives you weekly check-ins like 'How are you feeling? What would help right now?'
4. Gives leaders specific, personalized suggestions for each team member
5. Makes it easy to send meaningful recognition

The whole point is to be stupidly simple - like 30 seconds or less per interaction - and to help people feel seen and understood."

**Questions:**

11. **What's your gut reaction to this idea?**
    - *Listen for: enthusiasm, skepticism, concerns*

12. **What would make you actually USE this weekly?**
    - *Listen for: motivators, must-have features*

13. **What would make you NOT use it?**
    - *Listen for: concerns, barriers, deal-breakers*

14. **What's missing from this concept that you'd need?**
    - *Listen for: feature gaps, integrations*

15. **(If they're a leader)** **Would you want your team using this? Why or why not?**
    - *Listen for: trust issues, privacy concerns, value prop*

16. **(If they're a leader)** **What would you pay for this if it actually improved team morale and retention?**
    - *Listen for: willingness to pay, budget constraints*

---

#### PART 4: The Big Picture (3-5 minutes)

17. **If we could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing about how recognition works at your company, what would it be?**
    - *Listen for: root problems, system issues*

18. **What else should I be thinking about that I haven't asked?**
    - *Open space for surprises*

---

#### CLOSING (2 minutes)

"This has been incredibly helpful. A few final things:

19. **Would you be open to testing an early version of this in a few months?**
    - *Capture email if yes*

20. **Is there anyone else you think I should talk to? Leaders? HR folks? People with strong opinions about workplace culture?**
    - *Ask for intros*

Thank you so much! I'll keep you posted on how this evolves."

## Synthesizing Results

After 15-20 interviews and 50+ survey responses, look for:

### Validation Signals ✅
- [ ] People immediately "get" the different categories
- [ ] They can easily identify their own preferences
- [ ] They share stories of mismatched recognition
- [ ] Leaders admit they're mostly guessing
- [ ] 70%+ say they'd use a simple tool
- [ ] Leaders willing to pay $5-15/user/month
- [ ] Current tools are seen as cumbersome or unused

### Warning Signals ⚠️
- [ ] Concept feels confusing or forced
- [ ] People say "my company would never support this"
- [ ] Privacy concerns dominate the conversation
- [ ] No willingness to pay
- [ ] "We already have a tool that does this"
- [ ] Interest is lukewarm at best

### Key Metrics to Track
- % who immediately resonate with framework
- Top 2 categories (are they distributed?)
- Current tools satisfaction (1-10 scale)
- Willingness to use (% yes/maybe)
- Willingness to pay (for leaders)
- # of people wanting to pilot

---

## Next Steps After Research

### If Validation is STRONG:
1. Synthesize findings into key insights doc
2. Refine feature prioritization based on feedback
3. Create clickable prototype of core flow
4. Set up pilot program with 5-10 committed teams
5. Start building MVP

### If Validation is MIXED:
1. Identify what resonated and what didn't
2. Pivot concept based on feedback
3. Do another round of focused interviews
4. Test revised concept before building

### If Validation is WEAK:
1. Honest assessment: Is this solving a real problem?
2. Consider: Different market? Different approach?
3. Don't build yet - dig deeper into the pain point

Good luck with your research! Let me know if you want help synthesizing the results.
